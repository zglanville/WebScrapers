# WebScrapers
My foray into web scraping

My interest in web scraper stems from the chip shortage that has been apparent in the past few years. In 2020 it was nigh on impossible to buy a GPU or even a PlayStation 5 because of this chip shortage.
At the time, there were websites that employed the use of web scrapers to find any stock availability on these products.
My interest was piqued and so I eventually decided to learn some web scraping. I know I have a long way to go, but I believe I have a very good base to build on in this subject.

So, I decided to learn some web scraping. I completed four projects, following some guides online. Every project increased in complexity over the previous project.
I encountered some issues where web pages used in guides had changed since the guides were made, most notably online stores, as new products were added or removed.
While writing the web scrapers, I had to figure out how to edit the code to work with the website in its current state.
Additionally, I added extra functionality to the web scrapers, challenging myself to go over and above on the instructions in the guides I was following.
I then wrote a web scraper from the ground up using the knowledge I had gained.
